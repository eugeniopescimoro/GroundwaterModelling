<h2 style="color: green;">My PhD</h2>
<p>My current PhD research focus is on anomalous transport models.
While at the University of Nottingham, together with our research group, I developed
OpenFOAM libraries for geostatistics, flow and transport modelling. Our main tools
are freely available on <a href="https://github.com/multiform-UoN/SECUReFOAM" >SECURe</a> GitHub repository .</p>
The image below is an example of pluri Gaussian truncated simulation generated
with the setRandomField OpenFOAM utility.

<p>Anomalous transport often arises from aquifers or geological structures which show sharp permeability contrasts
  between adjacent sediments. This is due to convoluted flow paths, recirculating zones or channelling effects.
  These phenomena play a pivotal role in determining the fate of solutes flowing through the subsurface thus its
  study fits many applications, from the forecast of a contaminant spread to the best aquifer remediation technique
  or the simulation of carbon storage reservoir. For these reasons, the understanding of the factors which lead to
  the onset of anomalous transport in strongly heterogeneous porous media is at the same time a great mathematical
  modelling challenge and an asset of capital importance for the development of future policies.</p>

<h3 style="color: blue;">Diffusion, advection and mechanical dispersion</h3>
<p>The spread of the solute through a porous matrix can be seen as a combination of advection, diffusion and
mechanical dispersion mechanisms.</p>

<p>The overall effect is indicated by the term hydraulic dispersion.</p>
